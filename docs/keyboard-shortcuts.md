# Keyboard Shortcuts

Schaltwerk is designed to be driven from the keyboard. These shortcuts are available system-wide.

## Session Management
- `⌘N` – Create a new running session from the current spec.
- `⌘Shift+N` – Create a new spec in the orchestrator.
- `⌘R` – Mark the active session as reviewed.
- `⌘S` – Convert the active running session back into a spec.

## Navigation
- `⌘1–9` – Jump directly to a session (the orchestrator is `⌘1`).
- `⌘↑` / `⌘↓` – Move through sessions in the current column.
- `⌘←` / `⌘→` – Switch between the Specs, Running, and Reviewed columns.

## Terminals
- `⌘T` – Focus the agent terminal.
- `⌘/` – Focus the shell terminal.

Keep these close at hand to flip between sessions, drive reviews, and keep your agents moving without reaching for the mouse.
