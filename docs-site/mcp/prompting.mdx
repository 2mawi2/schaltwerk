## Example Workflows

### 1. Creating Multiple Specs

**You:** "I need to build a complete authentication system. Create Schaltwerk specs for each part."

**Claude creates:**
- `auth-registration` - User signup with validation
- `auth-login` - Login with JWT tokens
- `auth-password-reset` - Password reset flow
- `auth-session-management` - Token refresh and logout

### 2. Starting Work

**You:** "Which spec should I start first?"

**Claude:** "Start with `auth-registration` since the other specs depend on it. Shall I start this session for you?"

**You:** "Yes, start it"

**Claude:** Starts the session - now visible in your sidebar

### 3. Reviewing Progress

**You:** "Show me the status of all auth sessions"

**Claude:**
- `auth-registration` - ‚úÖ Reviewed, ready to merge
- `auth-login` - üîÑ Running
- `auth-password-reset` - üìù Spec (not started)
- `auth-session-management` - üìù Spec (not started)

### 4. Merging Work

**You:** "The auth-registration session looks good. Merge it to main."

**Claude:**
1. Checks tests pass
2. Verifies no conflicts
3. Merges to main
4. Cleans up the session
