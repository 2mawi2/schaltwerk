title: Core Concepts
description: 'Understand sessions, specs, the orchestrator, and terminal management'
---

Schaltwerk revolves around isolated git worktrees and the lifecycle of each AI-driven session. These concepts are the backbone of the app.

## Sessions

<Card title="What is a Session?" icon="laptop-code">
  Every running session is a dedicated git worktree branching from your repository. Two terminals come with each session so agents and humans can work side-by-side.
</Card>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Isolated Worktrees" icon="git-alt">
    Each session gets its own git worktree and branch
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dual Terminals" icon="terminal">
    Top terminal for the agent, bottom terminal for manual commands
  </Card>
  <Card title="Instant Switching" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Switch between sessions instantly—terminals stay alive in the background
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sidebar Organization" icon="list">
    Sessions appear in the left sidebar under **Agents**
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Every worktree is its own copy of the repository on disk. Keep sessions short-lived and clean up finished work so the `.schaltwerk/worktrees/` folder doesn’t grow without bound.
</Tip>

### Session Filters

Use the tabs at the top of the session list to filter what you see:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="All">
    Shows all sessions regardless of state
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Specs">
    Shows only draft specs (amber badge)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Running">
    Shows active sessions with worktrees
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Reviewed">
    Shows sessions marked as ready for merge
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Specs

<img src="/logo/specs-workflow.svg" alt="Specs workflow" className="w-full max-w-4xl mx-auto my-8" />

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Markdown Planning" icon="file-lines">
    Specs are markdown documents that live in the orchestrator
  </Card>
  <Card title="Capture Intent" icon="lightbulb">
    Capture the desired outcome before any code is written
  </Card>
<Card title="Agent Prompts" icon="message">
  When started, the spec becomes the agent's first prompt
</Card>
<Card title="Amber Badge" icon="bookmark">
  Specs carry an amber badge until you start them
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  Think of specs as reusable backlog cards. Start them when you're ready, and if a session isn't working out, press `⌘S` to discard the worktree, keep the spec intact, and retry later with new instructions.
</Info>

### Spec Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Draft the spec">
    Write a markdown document describing the desired outcome
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the session">
    Convert the spec into a running session with worktree and terminals
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent receives prompt">
    The spec content becomes the agent's initial instructions
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Orchestrator

<Card title="The Control Panel" icon="tower-control" color="#22d3ee">
  The orchestrator runs directly on your main branch and never creates a worktree. Use it to draft specs, launch multiple sessions, and coordinate reviews.
</Card>

### Orchestrator Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Main Branch Access">
    The orchestrator stays on your main branch, giving you a stable workspace for planning and coordination.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Spec Creation">
    Draft multiple specs before launching sessions. Perfect for planning parallel work streams.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="MCP REST API">
    The orchestrator powers automation through the MCP REST API, enabling external tools to create and manage sessions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dual Terminals">
    Like regular sessions, the orchestrator has an agent terminal on top and your shell below.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Accessing the Orchestrator

<CodeGroup>
```bash Keyboard Shortcut
⌘1
```

```plaintext Sidebar
Click "Repository (Orchestrator)" at the top of the sidebar
```
</CodeGroup>

## Session States

Sessions transition through three explicit states:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Spec" icon="file-pen">
    **Drafting the work.** No worktree yet.

    - Markdown document in the orchestrator
    - Amber badge in sidebar
    - Can be edited or deleted without affecting git
  </Step>

  <Step title="Running" icon="play">
    **Active session.** The session owns a worktree and active terminals.

    - Git worktree created under `.schaltwerk/worktrees/`
    - Two PTY terminals spawned
    - Agent process can run in top terminal
    - Magenta badge in sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reviewed" icon="check">
    **Ready for merge.** The worktree is ready for integration.

    - Code has been tested locally
    - Green badge in sidebar
    - Can still make manual edits in worktree
    - Integration options:
      - `⌘⇧M` - Direct merge to main
      - `⌘⇧P` - Create GitHub pull request
  </Step>
</Steps>

### State Transitions

<Info>
  Transitions are explicit and user-controlled. The app never automatically changes session states.
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Spec → Running">
    **Keyboard:** `⌘N`

    **Action:** Start Agent

    **Result:** Creates worktree, branch, and terminals
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Running → Reviewed">
    **Keyboard:** `⌘R`

    **Action:** Mark as Reviewed

    **Result:** Flags session as ready for merge
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Running → Spec">
    **Action:** Convert to Spec

    **Result:** Removes worktree but keeps spec content for later
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Terminals

<Card title="PTY Terminal Management" icon="window" color="#22d3ee">
  Schaltwerk spawns PTY (pseudo-terminal) terminals using the session's worktree as the working directory.
</Card>

### Terminal Layout

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Top Terminal" icon="robot" color="#ec4899">
    **Agent Process**

    Reserved for the configured agent. Automatically launches after setup script finishes.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Bottom Terminal" icon="user" color="#22c55e">
    **Your Shell**

    Manual command execution. Includes a **Run** button (`⌘E`) when a project run script is configured.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Terminal Persistence

<Check>Terminals persist until you close the session</Check>
<Check>Context switches between sessions are instant</Check>
<Check>Background terminals continue running</Check>
<Check>Working directory is always the session's worktree</Check>

### Run Button

When a project run script is configured in Settings:

1. Click the **Run** button in the bottom terminal
2. Or press `⌘E`
3. The configured script executes in the session's worktree
4. Perfect for launching dev servers or tests without leaving the app

### Open in External Editor

Click the "Open" dropdown in the top bar to open the session's worktree in your preferred editor:

![Open dropdown menu showing options for Finder, Cursor, VS Code (checked), IntelliJ IDEA, Ghostty, Warp, and Terminal](/images/open-in-editor.png)

Schaltwerk detects installed editors and lets you work in your preferred environment while managing sessions.
