Here are our recommendations for how to get the most out of Schaltwerk.

## Core Principles

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="One Session Per Feature" icon="layer-group">
    Create a dedicated session for each feature or bugfix. Keep work isolated and manageable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review Before Merge" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Always review changes with `⌘G` and test before merging. Agents make mistakes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clean Up After Merge" icon="broom">
    Cancel sessions with `⌘D` after successful merge to keep your workspace tidy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use the Orchestrator" icon="chess-queen">
    Plan and coordinate work in the orchestrator (`⌘1`) before creating sessions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Recommended Workflow

### 1. Plan in the Orchestrator

Press `⌘1` to switch to the orchestrator—a special session that stays on your main branch.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a spec">
    Press `⌘⇧N` to create a planning document:
    - Break down the feature into tasks
    - List requirements and constraints
    - Document the architecture

    ![Create new spec dialog with agent name field, 'Create as spec' checkbox checked, spec content textarea with user story, and Create Spec button](/images/create-spec.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask the orchestrator">
    Use the orchestrator's agent terminal to:
    - Get implementation suggestions
    - Generate task breakdowns
    - Plan the overall approach
  </Step>

  <Step title="Convert to sessions">
    Once you have a plan, create individual sessions for each task

    ![Spec management view showing multiple specs in sidebar with Run Agent and Copy buttons, markdown editor displaying spec content with goals, context, and requirements](/images/spec-management.png)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Create Sessions

For each feature or task:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Press ⌘N">
    Open the New Session dialog
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name it descriptively">
    Use names like:
    - `feature-auth` not `session1`
    - `fix-typescript-errors` not `fixes`
    - `refactor-api-layer` not `refactor`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write a clear prompt">
    Be specific about what you want:

    **Good:**
    > "Add JWT-based authentication with login, logout, and token refresh endpoints. Use bcrypt for password hashing."

    **Bad:**
    > "Add auth"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select the right agent">
    - **Complex refactoring?** Use Claude Code
    - **Quick fixes?** Use Codex
    - **Experimenting?** Try different agents
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 3. Monitor Progress

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Agent Terminal (⌘T)">
    Watch the agent work in real-time:
    - See which files it's reading
    - Understand its reasoning
    - Spot issues early

    **Tip:** You can interact with the agent while it works. Just type in the terminal.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Your Shell (⌘/)">
    Use the bottom terminal to:
    - Run tests as the agent works
    - Check git status with `git status`
    - Inspect changes with `git diff`
    - Run build commands
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Run Mode (⌘E)">
    If you've configured a run script:
    - Press `⌘E` to start your dev server or test suite
    - Monitor output in real-time
    - Press `⌘E` again to stop
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 4. Review Changes

Before marking as reviewed:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the diff (⌘G)">
    Review every change the agent made:
    - Check for unintended modifications
    - Look for commented-out code
    - Verify no secrets were added
  </Step>

<Step title="Run tests">
    In the bottom terminal or with `⌘E`:
    > Swap `bun` for `npm` if you're using npm scripts.
    ```bash
    bun run test    # or: npm run test
    bun run lint    # or: npm run lint
    bun run build   # or: npm run build
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test manually">
    Actually use the feature:
    - Start the dev server
    - Test the happy path
    - Try edge cases
    - Check error handling
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 5. Mark as Reviewed

When you're confident:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Press ⌘R">
    Marks the session as reviewed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Session moves to Reviewed filter">
    Use `⌘←/→` to switch between All/Specs/Running/Reviewed
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 6. Merge or PR

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Solo Developer">
    Press **`⌘⇧M`** to merge directly to main:
    - Fast and simple
    - No PR overhead
    - Good for personal projects

    <Warning>Make sure you reviewed and tested first!</Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Team Environment">
    Press **`⌘⇧P`** to create a GitHub PR:
    - Code review from teammates
    - CI/CD validation
    - Discussion and approval process

    **Requirements:**
    - `gh` CLI installed and authenticated
    - Push access to remote repo
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 7. Clean Up

After successful merge:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Press ⌘D">
    Cancel the session and remove the worktree
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm deletion">
    Schaltwerk asks for confirmation to prevent accidents
  </Step>

  <Step title="Worktree is removed">
    The isolated git worktree and branch are deleted
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Patterns

### Feature Development

```
1. ⌘1 (Orchestrator) → Plan the feature
2. ⌘⇧N → Create spec with requirements
3. ⌘N → Start session with detailed prompt
4. ⌘T → Monitor agent progress
5. ⌘G → Review changes
6. ⌘E → Run tests
7. ⌘R → Mark as reviewed
8. ⌘⇧P → Create PR
9. [After merge] ⌘D → Clean up
```

### Bug Fix

```
1. ⌘N → Create session: "Fix bug in X"
2. ⌘/ → Reproduce the bug manually
3. ⌘T → Let agent investigate and fix
4. ⌘/ → Verify the fix works
5. ⌘G → Review the changes
6. ⌘R → Mark reviewed
7. ⌘⇧M → Merge directly (if solo)
8. ⌘D → Clean up
```

### Refactoring

```
1. ⌘1 → Discuss approach with orchestrator
2. ⌘⇧N → Create spec documenting the refactor plan
3. ⌘N → Start session with clear constraints
4. ⌘T → Watch agent work
5. ⌘E → Run test suite frequently
6. ⌘G → Carefully review all changes
7. ⌘/ → Run tests again manually
8. ⌘R → Mark reviewed
9. ⌘⇧P → Create PR for team review
10. [After approval + merge] ⌘D → Clean up
```

## Things to Avoid

<Warning>
  **Don't:**
  - Merge without reviewing (`⌘G` first!)
  - Cancel sessions before merging (use `⌘S` to recycle the spec—this deletes the session worktree/branch and loses uncommitted changes)
  - Create vague prompts like "fix it"
  - Forget to run tests before marking reviewed
  - Let sessions pile up—clean up after merging
  - Work directly in the orchestrator for features (create sessions instead)
</Warning>
