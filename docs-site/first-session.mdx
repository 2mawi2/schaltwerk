title: Your First Session
description: 'Create and run your first AI agent in Schaltwerk'
---

Once you've installed Schaltwerk, it's time to create your first session.

## Open Your Repository

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch Schaltwerk">
    Open the app from Applications or via terminal:
    ```bash
    open -a Schaltwerk
    ```

    > Prefer the CLI? Running `schaltwerk` or `just run` always lands on the Home screen first. Pick a repository manually every time—no project is auto-selected on startup.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open a project">
    On the Home screen, click **Open Repository** and select your Git repository.

    <Info>Schaltwerk verifies that the folder is a valid Git repository before opening it.</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Recent Projects">
    The project is added to **Recent Projects** for quick access next time
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Alternative:** Click **New Project** to create a new empty Git repository
</Tip>

## Create a Session

Sessions are where AI agents work. Each session runs in its own isolated [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) with its own branch.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Press ⌘N">
    This opens the **New Session** dialog

    ![Start new agent dialog showing agent name field, initial prompt tabs, base branch selection, agent dropdown, model selector, and permission settings](/images/new-agent-modal.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter a task description">
    Choose your prompt source:
    - **Custom prompt** — Write your own task description
    - **GitHub issue** — Import an issue with its description, labels, and comments
    - **GitHub PR** — Import a PR with its context and discussion

    ![GitHub issue search showing issue list with title, status, and labels](/images/start-from-github-issue-or-pr.png)

    <Tip>
      GitHub import requires the `gh` CLI to be installed and authenticated. The issue/PR content becomes the agent's initial prompt.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select your agent">
  Choose which agent to use:
  - **GitHub Copilot** - Great for iterative tasks; requires `npm install -g @github/copilot` and trusting the worktree once
  - **Claude Code** - Best for complex refactoring and understanding large codebases
  - **OpenCode** - Open-source option
  - **Codex** - Fast, efficient, great for smaller tasks
  - **Gemini** - Alternative AI assistant
  - **Kilo Code** - Powerful CLI with architect and autonomous modes
  - **Qwen** - Alibaba's advanced AI coding assistant
  - **Factory Droid** - Specialized agent for code generation and automation
  - **Amp** - Advanced coding agent with powerful tools
  - **Terminal Only** - Manual work without AI agents, opens only a usable terminal

    <Info>For AI agents, make sure you've configured them in Settings. See [Agent Setup](/guides/agent-setup) for details. Terminal Only mode doesn't require configuration.</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose base branch">
    Select which branch the session should start from (usually `main` or `develop`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Press ⌘Enter to start">
    Schaltwerk will:
    1. Create a new git branch named `schaltwerk/<session-name>`
    2. Create an isolated [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) at `.schaltwerk/worktrees/<session-name>/`
    3. Spawn two terminals (agent terminal on top, your shell below)
    4. Start the agent with your task description

    ![Full Schaltwerk interface showing sidebar with sessions, agent terminal on top displaying code analysis, and shell terminal below](/images/schaltwerk-agent-view.png)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Watch Your Agent Work

The agent appears in the sidebar and starts working immediately.

![Session card showing 'tooltip-duplicate-fix' with Idle status, filter tabs for Specs/Running/Reviewed, and action buttons including code view, refresh, mark reviewed, archive, and cancel](/images/session-card-and-filter.png)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Top Terminal (Agent)">
    Shows the AI agent's output in real-time. Watch as it:
    - Reads and understands your codebase
    - Makes edits across multiple files
    - Runs tests and validates changes

    **Press `⌘T`** to focus this terminal
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bottom Terminal (Your Shell)">
    Your personal shell in the session's worktree. Use it to:
    - Run tests manually
    - Inspect changes with `git diff`
    - Execute build commands

    **Press `⌘/`** to focus this terminal
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Run Mode">
    Configure a run script in **Settings → Run & Environment → Run Script**, then press **`⌘E`** to execute it in the bottom terminal.

    Perfect for starting dev servers, running test suites, or building the project.

    ![Run tab showing build output with compilation progress, multiple terminal tabs, and Run button with ⌘E shortcut](/images/run-tab.png)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Review Changes

Once the agent is done (or you want to check progress):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the diff">
    Press `⌘G` to view all changes the agent made. The **Changes** tab shows all modified files with line counts:

    ![Changes tab showing file list with Open diffs inline checkbox and line counts](/images/inline-sidebar-diff.png)

    Toggle **Open diffs inline** to review directly in the sidebar, or leave it off to open a full-screen modal.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review inline">
    Click a file to open its diff. With inline mode enabled, the diff opens right in the sidebar—no context switching. Click **Back to List** to return to the file list.

    ![Inline diff view showing code changes with Add Review Comment form](/images/inline-sidebar-comment.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add review comments">
    Select lines in the diff (click the + icons on the left) to add comments:
    - Type your feedback in the comment form
    - Click **Submit** to add the comment
    - Click **Finish Review** (or `⌘Enter`) to send all comments to the agent terminal

    The agent receives your formatted feedback and can address each issue.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the changes">
    Use the bottom terminal (`⌘/`) or Run Mode (`⌘E`) to:
    - Run your test suite
    - Start the dev server
    - Verify the changes work as expected
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Mark as Reviewed

When you're satisfied with the changes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Press ⌘R">
    This marks the session as **Reviewed**

    The session moves to the "Reviewed" filter in the sidebar

    ![Reviewed session card with green checkmark, showing GitHub PR button, merge button, refresh button, and cancel button](/images/pr-merge-reviewed-sessions.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Session is ready for merge">
    You can now:
    - **Merge to main** with `⌘⇧M`
    - **Create a PR** with `⌘⇧P`
    - Continue working on it (edit files, run more commands)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Merge or Create PR

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Merge to Main">
    Press **`⌘⇧M`** to merge directly to your base branch.

    Schaltwerk will:
    1. Switch to the base branch
    2. Merge the session branch
    3. Push changes (if configured)

    <Warning>Only use direct merge if you're working solo or on trusted changes</Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Create Pull Request">
    Press **`⌘⇧P`** to create a GitHub PR.

    Requirements:
    - GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
    - Connected project + push access to `origin`

    ![GitHub CLI status showing installed, authenticated, repository name, default branch, account, with options to reconnect or refresh status](/images/connect-github.png)

    Schaltwerk opens a PR dialog where you can choose a strategy (**Squash changes** vs **Use existing commits**), adjust the title/body, pick a base branch, and optionally push to a custom PR branch name.

    See the full PR guide (including linking PRs and fetching review comments): [Pull Requests](/guides/pull-requests)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Clean Up

After merging, clean up the session:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Press ⌘D">
    Cancels the session and removes the worktree

    <Warning>This is destructive! Only cancel after successfully merging.</Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm deletion">
    Schaltwerk will ask for confirmation before removing the worktree
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Want to keep the plan but scrap the current run? Press **`⌘S`** to convert the session back to a spec—this deletes the session worktree and branch (uncommitted changes are lost) while preserving the markdown so you can relaunch later.
</Tip>
