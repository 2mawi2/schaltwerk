---

This guide walks through the daily workflow of creating specs, running agents, reviewing their output, and keeping your repository clean.

## First Session Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open orchestrator">
    Press `⌘1` or click **orchestrator** in sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create spec">
    Press `⌘⇧N` and describe what you want the agent to build
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start session">
    Press `⌘N` to create worktree, branch, and terminals
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor agent">
    Top terminal shows agent progress automatically
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and review">
    Run tests in bottom terminal, then press `⌘R` to mark as reviewed
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Learn the Layout

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Top Bar" icon="bars">
    - Tabs for each open project
    - Gear icon for Settings
    - **Open** button to launch active worktree in Finder/editor
  </Card>

  <Card title="Sidebar" icon="sidebar">
    - Orchestrator entry
    - Session filters (All/Specs/Running/Reviewed)
    - Quick actions for starting agents or creating specs
  </Card>

  <Card title="Center" icon="window">
    - Terminals and diff/review panels
    - Grouped per session
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Create a Spec

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select orchestrator">
    Press `⌘1` to work on the main repo branch
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create new spec">
    Click **Create Spec** in sidebar footer or press `⌘⇧N`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write requirements">
    Fill out the markdown prompt with:
    - Requirements
    - Test expectations
    - Acceptance criteria
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save for later">
    Specs stay in the orchestrator until you promote them
    - Edit anytime
    - Duplicate for variations
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Keep specs focused so agents work on small, testable changes.
</Tip>

## Start a Session

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select spec">
    Highlight the spec in the sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start agent">
    Click **Start Agent** or press `⌘N`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Worktree created">
    Schaltwerk creates:
    - New git worktree in `.schaltwerk/worktrees/<session-name>/`
    - Dedicated branch with project's branch prefix
    - Two PTY terminals
  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup runs">
    - Configured worktree setup script runs once
    - When complete, top terminal launches your agent
    - Agent receives the spec content as initial prompt
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  The session moves to the **Running** filter and opens two terminals the first time you view it.
</Info>

## Run Your Agent

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Top Terminal">
    <Card icon="robot" color="#ec4899">
      **Agent Process**

      - Streams the agent process automatically
      - Use **Restart** action to reload with new prompt/config
      - Agent receives spec content as initial instructions
    </Card>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Bottom Terminal">
    <Card icon="terminal" color="#22c55e">
      **Your Shell**

      - Regular shell rooted in session worktree
      - Use for tests, formatting, helper scripts
      - Shows **Run** button when project run script configured
      - Press `⌘E` to execute run script
    </Card>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Run Mode

Configure Run Mode in Settings to map `⌘E` to a common command:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Example: Tests
npm run test
```

```bash Example: Dev Server
npm run dev
```

```bash Example: Build
npm run build
```
</CodeGroup>

The bottom terminal shows a status header while the command runs.

## Review the Work

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Switch Sessions" icon="arrows-rotate">
    - `⌘1–9` to jump to specific session
    - `⌘↑/⌘↓` to cycle through sessions
    - Terminals stay alive when you change focus
  </Card>

  <Card title="Inspect Changes" icon="code-compare">
    - View diffs in the right panel
    - Leave notes in the spec
    - Send instructions through agent terminal
  </Card>

  <Card title="Run Tests" icon="flask">
    - Execute test suite in bottom terminal
    - Or use Run Mode (`⌘E`)
    - Verify before marking as reviewed
  </Card>

  <Card title="External Editor" icon="code">
    - Click **Open** in top bar
    - Opens worktree in Finder or editor
    - Make manual edits if needed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  Always run tests before marking a session as reviewed!
</Warning>

## Mark as Reviewed

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify tests pass">
    Run your project's test suite in the bottom terminal
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark reviewed">
    Press `⌘R` or click the checkmark action
  </Step>

  <Step title="Session moves to Reviewed">
    Session badge turns green and appears in **Reviewed** filter
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose next action">
    From session header actions:
    - Create GitHub pull request
    - Merge directly
    - Export branch
    - Continue editing in external editor
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Convert Back to a Spec

Need to pause development but keep notes?

<CodeGroup>
```bash Keyboard Shortcut
⌘S
```
</CodeGroup>

**What happens:**
- Worktree is removed
- Markdown spec is preserved
- Session returns to **Specs** filter
- Can be restarted later as a fresh session

<Info>
  Perfect for deferring work or archiving exploratory sessions.
</Info>

## Merge and Clean Up

<Steps>
  <Step title="Merge the branch">
    After merging or cherry-picking the reviewed branch:
    - Use GitHub PR flow
    - Or merge directly from command line
  </Step>

  <Step title="Cancel session">
    Press `⌘D` or click **Cancel Session**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Cleanup happens">
    - Worktree is removed from `.schaltwerk/worktrees/`
    - Terminals are closed
    - Session disappears from sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Recreate if needed">
    You can always recreate from:
    - The spec (if preserved)
    - Git history (if branch still exists)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  Schaltwerk never cancels sessions automatically, so it's safe to keep a branch around while you validate changes.
</Check>

<Tip>
  Master the keyboard shortcuts to speed up your workflow. See the complete [Keyboard Shortcuts](/guides/keyboard-shortcuts) reference.

## Tips for Smooth Sessions

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Small Changes" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    Keep specs focused on small, testable changes that agents can complete confidently
  </Card>

  <Card title="Parallel Work" icon="bars-staggered">
    Use separate sessions for competing implementations and pick the best result
  </Card>

  <Card title="Orchestrator Power" icon="tower-control">
    The orchestrator can coordinate multiple agents in parallel while you monitor progress

## Common Workflows

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Bug Fix">
    1. Create spec describing the bug and expected behavior
    2. Start session and let agent investigate
    3. Review proposed fix and run tests
    4. Mark as reviewed and create PR
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="New Feature">
    1. Draft detailed spec with requirements and acceptance criteria
    2. Start session with focused scope
    3. Agent implements feature in isolated worktree
    4. Test locally in bottom terminal
    5. Review, adjust, and merge when ready
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Refactoring">
    1. Create spec outlining refactoring goals
    2. Start session on dedicated branch
    3. Agent performs refactoring
    4. Verify tests still pass
    5. Review changes carefully before merging
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Exploration">
    1. Create spec for experimental approach
    2. Start multiple sessions with different strategies
    3. Compare results across sessions
    4. Keep best approach, convert others to specs or cancel
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
