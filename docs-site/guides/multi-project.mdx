title: Multi-Project Workflows
description: 'Manage multiple repositories and agent teams side by side'

Schaltwerk makes it easy to orchestrate several repos at once—perfect for teams that split backend, frontend, and infrastructure into separate projects. Each repository opens in its own top-level tab, complete with orchestrator and session columns. Use the shortcuts below to keep everything in sync.

## Open Multiple Projects

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open first project">
    Launch Schaltwerk and open your primary repository (e.g., backend). The orchestrator runs on its base branch and manages specs/sessions for that repo.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add another repo">
    Click **Home** in the top-left corner, choose the next repository (e.g., frontend), and open it. Schaltwerk adds a new project tab with its own orchestrator and session list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Repeat for additional services">
    Keep adding tabs for QA environments, infrastructure scripts, or partner services. Each project stays isolated with its own worktree root.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Keep Worktrees Lean

<Tip>
  Each project tab maintains its own `.schaltwerk/worktrees/` folder. Cancel or merge sessions when you finish to reclaim disk space—especially when juggling multiple repos.
</Tip>

## Coordinate Cross-Repo Features

<Steps>
  <Step title="Draft specs per repo">
    Use the orchestrator in each project to capture backend/frontend/API specs that depend on each other. Keep links or shared acceptance criteria in the spec content.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch parallel sessions">
    Start agents in each repo (for example, backend schema update, frontend UI, infra automation). Monitor progress by switching tabs with `⌘⇧←/→`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate repo by repo">
    Merge each project once tests pass. If a change upstream requires adjustments downstream, convert that project’s session back into a spec (`⌘S`)—the session worktree/branch is deleted, but the markdown prompt stays ready for another run.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

- **Project tab missing?** Reopen the repository with `⌘⇧O`—Schaltwerk restores the orchestrator and session list automatically.
- **Worktrees piling up?** Cancel reviewed sessions (`⌘D`) or convert them to specs to clean up disk usage.
- **Need shared context?** Store shared prompts or instructions in a workspace-wide `AGENTS.md` and link to it from each repo’s specs.

With multi-project tabs and quick switching, you can coordinate agents across a whole product suite while keeping each codebase tidy and isolated.
