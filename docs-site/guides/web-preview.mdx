Schaltwerk includes a built-in web preview panel for viewing localhost development servers directly in the app. When you click a localhost link in terminal output, it opens in the preview panel automatically—no browser switching required.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a dev server">
    Run your development server in the terminal (e.g., `npm run dev`, `bun run dev`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click the localhost link">
    When the server logs a URL like `http://localhost:3000`, click it in the terminal output

  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview opens automatically">
    The right panel switches to the Preview tab and loads your site

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  By default, clicking localhost URLs in terminals opens them in the preview panel. To open them in your browser instead, go to **Settings → Run & Environment** and disable "Preview localhost on terminal click".
</Info>

## Developing Web Apps

The preview panel lets you see your web app while agents make changes. Hot module replacement works seamlessly—as the agent modifies code, the preview updates automatically.

**Supported URL formats:**
- Bare port: `3000` → `http://localhost:3000`
- Hostname: `localhost:3000` → `http://localhost:3000`
- Full URL: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

You can also type directly in the address bar or enter just a port number.

## Giving Feedback with Element Picker

The element picker lets you select any element on the page and send its HTML to the agent—perfect for pointing out specific UI issues.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the element picker button">
    In the preview toolbar, click the element picker button

  </Step>

  <Step title="Hover and click an element">
    Move your cursor over the page—elements highlight as you hover. Click to select one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="HTML appears in the terminal">
    The selected element's HTML is pasted as a code block in the active terminal, ready for the agent to see

  </Step>

  <Step title="Continue the conversation">
    Now you can tell the agent exactly what to change: "Make this button blue" or "Add padding to this card"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Toolbar Controls

From left to right:

- **Back / Forward arrows** — Navigate through your browsing history
- **Refresh** — Reload the current page
- **Open external** — Open the URL in your default browser
- **Element picker** — Enable element selection mode
- **URL input** — Enter a URL or port number
- **Zoom** — Adjust the preview scale (50%–200%)

**Keyboard shortcuts:** `⌘=` zoom in, `⌘-` zoom out, `⌘0` reset zoom

## Multiple Sessions

When running multiple sessions with dev servers, use different ports to avoid conflicts:

```bash
# Session 1
PORT=3001 npm run dev

# Session 2
PORT=3002 npm run dev
```

Each session maintains its own preview URL, so you can switch between sessions without losing your place.

## Limitations

- **No DevTools** — For full debugging, click the external link button to open in your browser
