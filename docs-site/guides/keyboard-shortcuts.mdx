## Customizing Shortcuts

All shortcuts can be customized in **Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts**:

![Keyboard Shortcuts settings panel showing Font Controls section with increase/decrease/reset font size shortcuts, and Navigation section with switch to orchestrator shortcut, each with Record, Reset, and Clear buttons](/images/keyboard-shortcuts.png)

Click **Record** to capture a new key combination, **Reset** to restore defaults, or **Clear** to remove a binding.

## Notes

<Warning>
  Some shortcuts may conflict with macOS system shortcuts. Check **System Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts** if they don't work as expected.
</Warning>

- Common conflicts: `⌘1–9` (app switching)
- Context-aware: Some shortcuts like `⌘Enter` and `⌘F` behave differently based on active context (terminal, diff viewer, etc.)
