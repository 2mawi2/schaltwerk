Schaltwerk is designed for keyboard-first workflows. You can manage multiple agents across multiple sessions without lifting your fingers from the keyboard.

## Navigation Overview

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd+Shift+←→` | Switch between project tabs |
| `Cmd+←→` | Switch between filters (All/Specs/Running/Reviewed) |
| `Cmd+↑↓` | Cycle through sessions in current filter |
| `Cmd+1-9` | Jump directly to a session (1 = orchestrator) |
| `Cmd+[ ]` | Switch terminal tabs (agent or shell, based on focus) |
| `Cmd+T` | Focus top terminal (agent) |
| `Cmd+/` | Focus bottom terminal (shell) |
| `Cmd+Shift+A` | Add tab in focused pane |
| `Cmd+W` | Close active tab in focused pane |
| `Cmd+G` | Open diff viewer |

## Terminal Focus

Schaltwerk uses a two-pane terminal layout:

- **Top pane**: Agent terminal — where Claude, Codex, or other agents run
- **Bottom pane**: Shell terminal — your personal shell for running tests, git commands, etc.

**Switching focus:**
1. `Cmd+T` focuses the top (agent) terminal
2. `Cmd+/` focuses the bottom (shell) terminal
3. `Cmd+[ ]` switches tabs within the focused pane
4. `Cmd+Shift+A` adds a tab in the focused pane (agent tab on top, shell tab on bottom)
5. `Cmd+W` closes the active tab in the focused pane

When focused on the top pane, `Cmd+[` and `Cmd+]` cycle through agent tabs. When focused on the bottom pane, they cycle through shell tabs. The same context-aware logic applies to `Cmd+Shift+A` and `Cmd+W`.

## Multi-Session Workflow

Run multiple agents in parallel and review their work:

```
1. Cmd+Shift+N  →  Create spec for task A
2. Cmd+N        →  Start session with Claude
3. Cmd+Shift+N  →  Create spec for task B
4. Cmd+N        →  Start session with Codex
5. Cmd+↑↓      →  Cycle between sessions to monitor progress
6. Cmd+G        →  Review changes in each session
7. Cmd+Shift+M  →  Merge completed work
```

## Quick Review Workflow

Review all running sessions without touching the mouse:

```
1. Cmd+→        →  Switch to Running filter
2. Cmd+↓        →  Select first session
3. Cmd+G        →  Open diff viewer
4. Cmd+Enter    →  Finish review (or add comments)
5. Cmd+↓        →  Next session
6. Repeat
```

## Multi-Project Workflow

Working on frontend and backend simultaneously:

```
1. Cmd+Shift+→  →  Switch to backend project
2. Cmd+2        →  Jump to session 2
3. Cmd+T        →  Check agent progress
4. Cmd+Shift+←  →  Switch back to frontend
```

## Customization

All shortcuts can be remapped in **Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts**. Click **Record** to capture a new key combination.

<Warning>
Some shortcuts may conflict with macOS system shortcuts. Check **System Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts** if they don't work as expected.
