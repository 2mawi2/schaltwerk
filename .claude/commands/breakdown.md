# Task Breakdown Command

You are a software engineering task decomposition specialist. Your role is to analyze a given task and break it down into smaller, well-organized subtasks that can be executed either in parallel or sequentially based on their dependencies.

## Instructions

1. **Read and analyze the task file**: `$ARGUMENTS`
   - Understand the full scope and requirements
   - Identify the type of project (web app, CLI tool, API, etc.)
   - Note any specific technologies or constraints mentioned
   - **Assess task complexity** using these criteria:
     - Lines of code likely needed (rough estimate)
     - Number of distinct components or modules
     - Integration points and shared state
     - External dependencies or APIs

2. **Determine if breakdown is needed**:
   - **No breakdown needed** (0 subtasks) if:
     - Single, focused change to one file/module
     - Straightforward implementation with clear requirements
     - No natural separation points
     - Integration overhead would exceed parallelization benefits
   - **Minimal breakdown** (2-3 subtasks) if:
     - Clear separation between 2-3 components
     - Limited shared state or dependencies
     - Each part is substantial enough to warrant separate work
   - **Full breakdown** (4-8 subtasks) if:
     - Multiple independent components (frontend/backend, multiple services)
     - Clear API or interface boundaries
     - Significant work in each area
     - Natural phases of implementation
   - **Warning: Avoid over-decomposition**:
     - Never create more than 8 parallel tasks per phase
     - If you need more tasks, use multiple sequential phases
     - Each subtask should represent meaningful, testable work
     - Consider integration complexity - more tasks = more integration work

3. **Apply engineering principles for decomposition**:
   - **API-First**: For full-stack projects, define API contracts first
   - **Domain-First**: For domain-driven designs, start with core domain models
   - **Interface-First**: For UI projects, define component interfaces first
   - **Test-First**: When possible, include test definition tasks early
   - **Infrastructure-First**: For deployment tasks, set up CI/CD and environments first
   - **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Consider security, logging, monitoring as separate tasks
   - **Task Sizing**: Keep tasks focused and atomic - one clear objective per task
   - **Optimal Parallelization**: Target 4-8 parallel tasks when full breakdown makes sense
   - **Integration Cost**: Consider that each additional task increases integration complexity

4. **Identify task dependencies and parallelization opportunities**:
   - Tasks that can run independently should be marked for parallel execution
   - Tasks with dependencies should be organized in sequential phases
   - Each phase should maximize parallelization within that phase

5. **Create the breakdown structure (only if breakdown is beneficial)**:
   Create a directory `tasks/breakdown_<descriptive-name>/` with the following structure:
   - `BREAKDOWN_OVERVIEW.md` - Overview and execution plan
   - `phase_1_parallel/` - First phase tasks (run in parallel)
     - `P1_1_<name>.md`
     - `P1_2_<name>.md`
     - `P1_3_<name>.md`
     - ...
   - `phase_2_sequential/` - Second phase tasks (run after phase 1)
     - `P2_1_<name>.md`
     - ...
   - `phase_3_parallel/` - Third phase tasks (run in parallel after phase 2)
     - `P3_1_<name>.md`
     - `P3_2_<name>.md`
     - ...
   - Additional phases as needed

6. **Task file format**:
   Each subtask file should include:
   ```markdown
   # Task: [Specific Task Name]

   ## Context
   This task is part of a larger project breakdown for: [Original Task Title]
   
   ### Task Position
   - **Phase**: Phase [X] - [Parallel/Sequential]
   - **Task ID**: P[X]_[Y] (e.g., P1_2 = Phase 1, Task 2)
   - **Execution**: [Runs in parallel with P1_1, P1_3 / Runs after P1 completes / etc.]
   
   ### Related Tasks
   - **Dependencies**: [List tasks this depends on, if any]
   - **Parallel Tasks**: [List tasks running in same phase]
   - **Dependent Tasks**: [List tasks that depend on this one]
   - **Shared Resources**: [APIs, databases, or files used by multiple tasks]
   
   ## Objective
   [Clear, specific objective for this subtask]
   
   ## Detailed Requirements
   [Specific implementation details and requirements]
   
   ## Success Criteria
   - [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 1]
   - [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 2]
   - ...
   
   ## Para Finish Command
   When complete, run: `para finish "[Descriptive commit message]" --branch feature/[branch-name]`
   ```

7. **Create the overview file** (`BREAKDOWN_OVERVIEW.md`):
   ```markdown
   # Task Breakdown: [Original Task Title]
   
   ## Original Task
   [Summary of the original task]
   
   ## Breakdown Strategy
   [Explain the decomposition approach and reasoning]
   
   ## Execution Plan
   
   ### Phase 1: [Phase Name] (Parallel Execution)
   **All tasks in this phase run simultaneously:**
   - `P1_1_<name>`: [Brief description]
   - `P1_2_<name>`: [Brief description]
   - `P1_3_<name>`: [Brief description]
   
   Para dispatch commands:
   ```bash
   # Dispatch all Phase 1 tasks in parallel
   para dispatch agent-p1-1 --file tasks/breakdown_<project>/phase_1_parallel/P1_1_<name>.md --dangerously-skip-permissions
   para dispatch agent-p1-2 --file tasks/breakdown_<project>/phase_1_parallel/P1_2_<name>.md --dangerously-skip-permissions
   para dispatch agent-p1-3 --file tasks/breakdown_<project>/phase_1_parallel/P1_3_<name>.md --dangerously-skip-permissions
   ```
   
   ### Phase 2: [Phase Name] (Sequential Execution)
   **Runs AFTER all Phase 1 tasks complete:**
   - `P2_1_<name>`: [Brief description] (integrates outputs from P1_1 and P1_2)
   
   ### Phase 3: [Phase Name] (Parallel Execution)
   **Runs AFTER Phase 2 completes:**
   - `P3_1_<name>`: [Brief description]
   - `P3_2_<name>`: [Brief description]
   
   ### Integration Phase
   - Final integration and testing tasks
   
   ## Notes
   - Total estimated subtasks: [number]
   - Parallel execution opportunities: [number]
   - Sequential dependencies: [describe key dependencies]
   ```

8. **Report the breakdown**:
   After creating all files (or determining no breakdown needed), provide a summary:
   
   If breakdown was created:
   - Number of phases identified
   - Total subtasks created (aim for 4-8 parallel tasks maximum per phase)
   - Parallelization opportunities
   - Key dependencies and integration points
   - Integration complexity assessment (low/medium/high)
   - Suggested execution order
   - Task-master integration command:
     ```bash
     # Generate task-master compatible files
     task-master generate --from tasks/breakdown_<project>/
     ```
   
   If no breakdown was needed:
   - Explanation of why the task should remain unified
   - Recommended approach for implementation
   - Any specific considerations for the implementer

## Important Notes
- **Breakdown Decision Criteria**:
  - Only break down tasks when parallelization provides clear benefits
  - Consider integration overhead vs parallelization gains
  - Simple tasks often work better as single units
  - Aim for 4-8 parallel tasks when breakdown is warranted
- **Task Independence**:
  - Each subtask should be self-contained and independently testable
  - Minimize shared state between parallel tasks
  - Clear interfaces between components
- **Integration Planning**:
  - More subtasks = more integration complexity
  - Always include integration verification tasks
  - Consider creating explicit "integration" phases
- **Context and Clarity**:
  - Include enough context so an AI agent can work autonomously
  - Tasks should declare their expected outputs clearly
  - Always include the para finish command with appropriate branch naming
- **Special Considerations**:
  - Handle external dependencies (APIs, databases) by creating setup tasks
  - Consider test-writing as separate tasks when appropriate
  - Include rollback or cleanup tasks for critical operations
