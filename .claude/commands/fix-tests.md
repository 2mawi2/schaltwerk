The tests are failing. Your goal is to get the tests to pass.
1.  Run all tests and identify failing tests. If an argument is provided (`$ARGUMENTS`), focus on that test first.
2.  Analyze the failing test(s) and the related source code to find the root cause.
3.  Implement the necessary fixes.
4.  Ensure your fixes do not break other tests and that all tests can run independently and in parallel.
5.  Ensure that all linting issues are solved.
5.  Repeat until all tests are completely green and all linting issues fixed.
